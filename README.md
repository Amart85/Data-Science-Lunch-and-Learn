# Every Monday: Data Science Lunch & Learn

Online at 12.30 BST / 13.30 CEST on [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/ibmdevelopereurope)

## Jupyter notebooks

Most of the events use a notebook to go through example code. We will mainly use Watson Studio to run these, but you can run them on any platform. To follow along in Watson Studio sign up for a free IBM Cloud account and create a Watson Service as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/data-science-lunch-and-learn/blob/master/watson-studio-instructions.md). To load a notebook you will need a raw link that you can find below for each event.
